### Key Features

#### 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection
- The system processes transactions in real-time to identify fraudulent activities.
- Notifications are sent immediately for high-risk transactions.

#### 2. Transaction and Fraud Monitoring Dashboard
- Displays recent transactions and fraud trends.
- Provides advanced analytics for each user profile and the associated risk.
- Users can analyze fraud trends and patterns dynamically.

#### 3. Fraud Reporting
- Allows users to submit suspicious transactions for further investigation.
- Helps improve fraud detection models with real-world data.

#### 4. Fraud Case Investigation
- Displays a list of pending fraud cases for review.
- Enables analysts to investigate and take necessary actions against fraudulent activities.

#### 5. Rule Engine
- Allows users to configure rules for fraud detection without domain knowledge.
- Example Rule: **Velocity Check**
  - **Condition**: Detects multiple transactions from the same user in a short time period.
  - **Logic**: `count(transactions) > 5 AND timespan < 10 minutes`
  - **Action**: Flag for review.
  - **Priority**: 1
  - **Category**: Velocity
  - **Triggers**: 120
  - **Effectiveness**: 95%

#### 6. APIs for Transactions, Rules, Alerts, and Analytics
- The system provides APIs for:
  - Transaction processing.
  - Rule management.
  - Fraud alerts and notifications.
  - Advanced fraud analytics.
- The system takes several parameters as input and returns a fraud classification result.

This solution ensures a comprehensive and efficient approach to fraud detection and management, leveraging AI models and rule-based detection for improved security and reliability.
